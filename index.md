## Welcome to BIC Software Pages

The activities of the Bioengineering and Computing Laboratory (BIC) are finalized to study the biomechanics of the musculoskeletal system by using numerical modeling at different scales, from system to micro-structure.

We work in a close collaboration with the clinics to develop personalized models from diagnostic data, and software tools supporting modeling and clinical decision making.

The strategic activities of the BiC Lab are:

1. Development, validation and applications of musculoskeletal numerical models to predict muscular and joint loads, and bone mechanical strength from diagnostic imaging, in physiological and pathological conditions
2. Development of software tools for computational bioengineering
3. Development of Decision Support Systems for the clinics, such as solutions for surgical planning of complex skeletal reconstructions
